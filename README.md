## Overview:
The Medicine Blockchain Record app is a decentralized solution designed to enhance the transparency, efficiency, and safety of the pharmaceutical supply chain. Built using blockchain technology, specifically Remix and Scroll, the app provides a secure and immutable log of medicine batches, tracking their journey from production to distribution. This ensures the authenticity of medicines, helps prevent the distribution of counterfeit drugs, and contributes to safeguarding public health.

## Objective:
The primary objective of the app is to create a reliable, transparent, and tamper-proof system for managing medicine batches. By recording essential details about each batch on the blockchain, the app aims to ensure that all stakeholders, including manufacturers, distributors, healthcare providers, and patients, have access to accurate and trustworthy information about the medicines they handle or consume.

## Aim:
The app aims to address critical challenges in the pharmaceutical industry, such as:

1. Counterfeit Drugs: Preventing the circulation of fake or substandard medicines.
2. Supply Chain Transparency: Providing a clear view of the entire supply chain, from production to patient delivery.
3. Accountability: Holding all participants in the supply chain accountable for their actions.

## Goal:
The long-term goal of the Medicine Blockchain Record app is to enhance public health outcomes by ensuring that only authentic, safe, and effective medicines are available in the market. The app also seeks to build trust among consumers, healthcare providers, and regulators by providing a verifiable record of medicine authenticity and quality.

## SDG Alignment and Public Goods Problem:
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs):

SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being: The app directly contributes to SDG 3 by improving the safety and effectiveness of medicines, ensuring that only genuine products reach consumers. By tracking the entire lifecycle of medicine batches, the app helps reduce the risks associated with counterfeit drugs, thus enhancing public health and well-being.


## Public Goods Problem:

1. Public Health and Safety: Medicines are a critical public good, and ensuring their quality and authenticity is essential for public health. The app addresses the public goods problem by providing a transparent and secure system that reduces the risk of counterfeit medicines, thereby protecting the health and safety of the population.
2. Transparency and Accountability: The app solves the issue of transparency in the healthcare supply chain, a common public goods problem. By creating an immutable record of medicine batches, the app ensures that all stakeholders are accountable for their role in the supply chain, promoting ethical practices and regulatory compliance.

## Healthcare Tracking
The Medicine Blockchain Record app is specifically focused on healthcare, providing a robust system for tracking medicine batches. It ensures that every step of the medicine's journey, from production to consumption, is recorded and verifiable. This level of tracking is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the healthcare system and ensuring that patients receive safe and effective treatments.
